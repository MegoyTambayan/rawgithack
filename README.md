===============

This is the source code behind [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).

The  idea  of this  service  is  inspired from  [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com).
I thought that use the whole framework (node.js with express.js)
for such a simple thing as requests proxying is overkill and
made the same stuff using nginx only.

This is also a game: I am trying to implement the same functionality using nginx
config files only. No programming languages allowed. Come join me!

Example config.lua
------------------

```lua
return {
   simsim = "SECRET",
   cf = {
      zone = "ZONE_ID",
      username = "USERNAME",
      api_key = "API_KEY",
      username = "USERNAME"
   },
   patreon = {
      campaign = "CAMPAIGN_ID",
      token = "ACCESS_TOKEN"
   }
}
```
